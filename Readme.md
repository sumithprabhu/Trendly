## 📌 About
Trendly is an AI-powered Web3 growth engine that fuses on-chain governance, AI , and social media strategy into a seamless ecosystem. Users can deploy DAOs, create and vote on proposals, and automate content on Twitter—all driven by a sophisticated AI agent.

Simply define an end goal (e.g., "Increase Twitter engagement"), and Trendly leverages Coinbase AgentKit and The Graph for on-chain tools like smart contract deployment, airdrops, giveaways, DEX analytics, memecoin insights and posts analytics to execute precision-driven growth strategies. It’s a self-learning, autonomous AI strategist engineered to amplify Web3 influence and engagement with zero manual effort. 🚀🔥
